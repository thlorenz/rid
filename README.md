# Rid

Rust integrated Dart framework providing an easy way to build Flutter apps with Rust.

## Welcome to Rid

This is the repository in which [_rid_](https://thlorenz.com/rid) development takes place. It contains all the
necessary crates to generate code from macro attributes.

`rid-build` to pull it all together and `rid-template-flutter` is here for now to get started with an app quickly until I build a `rid`
CLI tool which combines the two.

_rid_ documentation will always live on the [main docs
section](https://thlorenz.com/rid-site/docs/getting-started/introduction/).

## Sponsors

Thank you very much for sponsoring me to help me keep working on _rid_ as well as open source
it fully as [explained here](https://thlorenz.com/rid-site/docs/contributing/sponsor/).

Feel free to ask any questions.

I just have one favor to ask from you. **Please do not fork this repository yet nor make it, or
contained code available publicly** as that would defeat the
[Sponsorware](https://github.com/sponsorware/docs) approach I chose to make _rid_ development
sustainable.

Additionally in order to keep the repository private yet allow sponsors to access it, I invite
them as collaborators. Please respect however that I expect you to **only read or use the
code**, but not push any updates to the repository. Any contribution should be [provided via a
pull request](https://thlorenz.com/rid-site/docs/contributing/how-to-contribute/).

A huge thanks for your support! 🙏 ❤️
